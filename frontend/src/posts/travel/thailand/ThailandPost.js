            <h3>why did i decide to study abroad in thailand?</h3>
            <p>being thai american, i never felt in touch with my heritage: i grew up in a white town, i can't speak thai fluently and i haven't met a lot of people in my family. 
                i decided that spending my last semester in thailand would give me the opportunity to connect with my culture and my family.
            </p>
            <h3>a little about the university i was studying at</h3>
            <p>i spent 3 months studying at mahidol university international college in salaya - a suburb about 20 minutes outside of bangkok. all of my classes were taught in english 
                and i was even able to take all of my major classes that i needed in order to graduate. most of my friends at the university were also international students, but i was also 
                able to get close with some natives (which feels weird to say because i'm literally thai too.. but anyways). my closest classmate was jason: we literally had all the same classes 
                together and we became close very quickly, even taking the weekends to go on our own excursions. i also got close to two thai students named peak and ploy.
            </p>
            <h3>salaya</h3>
            <p>this was basically my home for 3 months. our program had dorms and my roommate was molly! me and molly also went on a lot of excursions which i will get into in 
                other posts. molly also became my late night therapist because i was going through a really bad breakup during this time LOL but anyways. yes salaya it was basically 
                thailand's version of a college town. streets were poppin with food stands. although would not be as poppin if it rained becaues shit would get so damn flooded... it was 
                basically a damn river out there fr
            </p>
            {// video of flood
            }
            <h3>bangkok</h3>
            <p>bangkok was all about shopping, food, cafes, and going out. throughout my semester i was able to go to animal cafes</p>
            {//pics of animal cafes
            }
            <p>some speakeasys</p>
            {//videos of speakeasy
            }
            <p>and how could i forget nana's palace or khao san road, yes i went to a ping pong show</p>
            {// videos and pictures of partying
            }
            <h3>ayutthaya</h3>
            <p>my first excursion outside of bangkok/salaya :P i spent a day in ayutthaya going around different ruins of temples. what i found most fascinating was how the heads of buddhist 
                statues were all cut off. this was because in the war between thailand and mayanmar, they cut off the heads because they were valuable to sell. it's crazy to see the remains 
                of the temples from the fires too... what could have been fr
            </p>
            {// pictures of ayutthaya
            }
            <h3>chiang mai</h3>
            <p>one of my favorite places we visited in thailand: here we went to an elephant santurary, cat and dog rescue, and a night market. i even got a damn dick whistle for my sister at 
                the market
            </p>
            {//picture of dick whistle

            <h3>ko samui and ko phanag</h3>
            <p>did i really visit thailand as a college student if i didn't go to the damn full moon party?</p>
            <p>but before i get into what went down in ko phanag, i need to go over how cursed ko samui was: i crashed a motorbike into a car (*that motorbike and car i crashed was owned by the same 
                person who also worked at the hostel i was staying at.. RIP), got lost trying to find a waterfall, ran out of gas after running away from dogs that were hella barking at us while tryna 
                find this damn waterfall, almost got kidnapped after we ran out of gas, and almost broke the girls 3rd car :/. but at least the beaches were lit
            </p>
            {// samui content
            }
            <p>my friend took me with her to go to pig island one day and it was so cute, look at the little piggies!</p>
            {// pig content
            }
            <p>now for the damn full moon party. there was like 20k people here on 1 damn beach it was crazy: they had fire shows, raves, hot foreigners, literally everything you can think of. i wish i 
                had a video of my friends climbing up the full moon party sign and dancing, but here's a picture of me and friends asses that we wrote "full moon" on. there were many more moons than just 
                the one in the sky that night..
            </p>
            {// full moon party content
            }
            <h3>kanchanaburi</h3>
            <p>after a few days partying hard asf, me and my friends decided to go to kanchanaburi for erawan national park. this place was absolutely gorgeous with the water falls</p>
            {// pictures of water fall
            }
            <p>we rented motorbikes in kanchanaburi, and ofc i did not drive because we already saw what happened last time... the waters though very beautiful were unforunately brown 
                when we went but that's okay too
            </p>
            <h3>krabi and phi phi islands</h3>
            <p>i really saved the best for last. krabi was my all time favorite place in thailand. i love the beach, the nature, the caves, and ofc the mushrooms. you can get $5 USD shroom shakes 
                on this damn island. i was my first time doing any psychadelic and this man made it hella strong.. but what i got out of the end was amazing, and i will never forget the time 
                i tripped shrooms on a random beach in thailand with my 2 friends.
            </p>
            <p>we took a boat tour around the islands near krabi, and it was beautiful as well!</p>
